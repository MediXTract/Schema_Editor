# MediXtract JSON Schema Summary

The **MediXtract JSON Schema Summary** outlines a standardized structure for defining clinical variables and tracking the per-patient performance of the automated extraction system (**MediXtract**) against human-validated data.

---

## Variable Definition Fields

Each clinical variable is defined by a set of required and optional fields:

| Field             | Requirement | Purpose                                                                                                                          | Key Content / Format                                                            |
| :---------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`anyOf`**       | Required    | Defines all valid data types and formats, including allowing `null` (missing data).                                              | Array of schema objects, e.g., `[{"type": "number"}, {"type": "null"}]`         |
| **`default`**     | Required    | The value to use when data is absent.                                                                                            | Must match a type in `anyOf`; typically `null`, `0`, or `""`                    |
| **`description`** | Required    | A human-readable definition, extraction rules, and context/units.                                                                | String, e.g., `"Gestational age at birth in completed weeks..."`                |
| **`group_id`**    | Required    | Logical category for grouping variables.                                                                                         | String, e.g., `"group_1"` or `"group_3"`                                        |
| **`options`**     | Conditional | Maps enumerated codes in the `enum` (if used in `anyOf`) to human-readable labels.                                               | Object, e.g., `{"0": "No", "1": "Yes"}`                                         |
| **`notes`**       | Optional    | Free-text observations on extraction patterns or challenges.                                                                     | String, e.g., `"Extraction easiest when discharge summary is present."`         |
| **`was_solved`**  | Optional    | Marks conditions resolved before per-patient review. Must include â‰¥1 subcategory flag, a `comment`, and `changed_at` (ISO 8601). | Object, e.g., `{"was_questioned": true, "comment": "...", "changed_at": "..."}` |
| **`performance`** | Optional    | Per-patient performance data detailing MediXtract's success against human validation.                                            | Object containing patient-specific status entries                               |

## Performance (Per-Patient)

Performance entries track how MediXtract fared for a **patientâ€“variable pair**, using a **mutually exclusive** set of statuses.

### Core Statuses

| Field           | Type               | Meaning / Usage                                                                    | Exclusivity Rule                                          |
| :-------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`matched`**   | Boolean (Optional) | MediXtractâ€™s extraction agrees with human-validated data.                          | Cannot coexist with `pending`, `unmatched`, or `blank`.   |
| **`unmatched`** | Object (Optional)  | MediXtract differs from human extraction. Must contain one or more *reason flags*. | Cannot coexist with `pending`, `matched`, or `blank`.     |
| **`blank`**     | Boolean (Optional) | Both MediXtract and human reviewer got a null for that variable.                   | Cannot coexist with `matched`, `unmatched`, or `pending`. |
| **`pending`**   | Boolean (Optional) | Review is still pending for the patientâ€“variable pair.                             | Cannot coexist with `matched`, `unmatched`, or `blank`.   |

---

### Reasons for `unmatched`

The `unmatched` object must contain flags indicating the cause of the discrepancy.

#### ðŸ”¹ Improvements (MediXtract Outperformed Human)

* **`filled_blank`**: MediXtract found a value the human missed.
* **`correction`**: MediXtract corrected a human error.
* **`standardized`**: MediXtract applied consistent formatting or calculation.
* **`improved_comment`**: MediXtract produced a better descriptive comment.

#### ðŸ”¹ Issues (Documentation or Ambiguity)

* **`missing_docs`**: Missing documentation likely caused the discrepancy.
* **`contradictions`**: Conflicting information exists in the source records.
* **`questioned`**: Ambiguous definition or scope requires expert clarification.

### Shared Context Fields

These fields provide essential context for all performance entries:

* **`severity`** â€” Numerical impact rating (1â€“10)
* **`comment`** â€” Human-readable explanation or rationale
* **`last_updated`** â€” Required ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of the latest modification

## Was Solved (Variable-Level)

The `was_solved` object indicates that a variable-level condition was resolved prior to per-patient evaluation.
Its presence implies **`was_solved = true`** for the variable.

| Subcategory Flag        | Meaning / Usage                                        |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **`was_missing_docs`**  | Previously missing documentation was addressed.        |
| **`was_questioned`**    | Prior definition or criteria ambiguity was clarified.  |
| **`was_personal_data`** | Recognized as personal data and handled appropriately. |

**Required fields when present:**

1. At least one subcategory flag must be set to `true`.
2. **`comment`** (string) â€” Describes what was solved and how.
3. **`changed_at`** (string, ISO 8601) â€” UTC timestamp of when the variable entered this solved state.
